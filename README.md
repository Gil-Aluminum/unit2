# unit2

Welcome to my Unit 2 final project
This project is about Data Pagination and Filtering

In this project, you'll use a common web development technique known as “pagination” to enhance the usability of a web page.

Iv'e started with a file that contained information for 42 students, including name, email, and picture. By using my JavaScript skills to display the first nine students on the page. Then I added navigation, also known as pagination buttons, that the user can click to display different pages of students.
